Develop an application that helps us to convert between different currencies. We will
assume that the base currency is EGP so this program will help us to convert between
EGP and any other currency and vice versa. The steps of the program is as follow :
- First, the program will prompt user to enter the currency type as follow :
- * Euro
- $ Dollar
- + British Pound
- Y yen
- R Riyal
- The program will ask the user to enter the selling price and buying price of the
corresponding currency in order.
- The program will ask user about the required action (buy/sell 0 for buy 1 for sell)
- Finally, the program will prompt user to enter the required amount to buy or sell. If
the user wants to buy, then you should display the amount * selling price. And if the
user wants to sell, then you should display the amount * buying price.
